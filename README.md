# EDHCubeGenerator

# This is a collection of MTG Cube/Deck Generators I made. Have fun experimenting
# This is intended for use on sites like Draftmancer and Untap.in 
# The Commander Cubes work best when drafted with at least 4 players with 3 packs of 20 cards or 4 packs of 15 cards.
# Use the one with 10 commanders for a more focussed experience and the one with 20 commanders for a more chaotic experience

# Jumpstart works like this: Each player picks 2 of their 6 commanders or 1 of 3 and then 1 of 3 again. Then delete the rest from the selection txt. It will generate the Jumpstart Decks after. Use both your commanders as partners in your new deck.
