# 2EDHCUBE + TAGS (Updated per user requests)
# Changes:
# 1) Removed CubeBasics list entirely (no dependency on 2CubeBasics.txt)
# 2) Do NOT force-add "top cards" separately â€” they are just part of the extra pool
# 3) Increase extra cards per commander to 50
# 4) If the cube size is < 480 at the end of the first pass, loop commanders again
#    and try to fill using any EDHREC deck category EXCEPT those tagged as game changers
#    (still avoiding duplicates). After that, if still short of 500, fill from commander/masters sets.
